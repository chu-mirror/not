{\bf 1. Sum and Summand}
$$
\sum_{k=1}^na_k \eqno(1)
$$

$$
\sum_{P(k)}a_k \eqno(2)
$$

the sum of the first $n$ integers

Each element $a_k$ of a sum is called a {\it term}.

$1+2+\cdots+2^{n-1}$ is supposed to denote a sum of $n$ terms.

to include in the sum precisely those terms

$(1)$ means ``sum over k, from $1$ to $n$.''

the $a_k$ is called the {\it summand}.

sum on index $k$

summation take place over the set of indices

take sums over index sets

the index variables of sums

$(2)$ means the sum of all terms $a_k$
such that $k$ is an integer satisfying a given property $P(k)$.
